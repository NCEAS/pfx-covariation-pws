## pfx-covariation-pws
This is the repository for the portfolio effects covariation subgroup focused in Prince William Sound. This work was done as part of a working group at NCEAS (https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/), K. Marshall et al. titled "Applying portfolio effects to the Gulf of Alaska ecosystem: Did multi-scale diversity buffer against the Exxon Valdez oil spill?"

The analysis and this paper focuses on evaluating hypotheses about drivers of productivity (recruits per spawner for salmon, recruits per spawning stock biomass for herring). The five hypotheses examined are:  
(1) density dependence (declining productivity as a function of density)  
(2) effects of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, as a pulse or press perturbation  
(3) changing environmental conditions  
(4) interspecific competition on juvenile fish  
(5) predation and / or competition from adult fish
