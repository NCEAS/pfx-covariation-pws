When you run it and change Vscale, you won't see much difference, unless the change is from ~ 1000 to 0.0001. But the take home is that large values of Vscale assign less weight to values near 0, and large Vscale are still skewed, but a bit more toward uniform values. I think this is how Jarrod has it parameterized too. Code below - Cheers,

N = 100000
V.scale = 1000 # CHANGE ME!
sd.xi = sqrt(V.scale)
xi = rnorm(N, 0, sd.xi)
tau.eta = rgamma(N, shape=0.5, rate=0.5) # chi^2 with 1 d.f.
sigma.theta = abs(xi)/sqrt(tau.eta) # cauchy = normal/sqrt(chi^2)

hist(sigma.theta,100,col="grey")
